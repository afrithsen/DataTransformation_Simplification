# Data Transformation & Simplification Project
In this project, I took on the role of a marketing analytics manager for a telecommunications company, focusing on a dataset representing 5,000 customers. The company was launching a new program to provide educational services to customers in financial need, and my role was to analyze the data to help identify those who would benefit most from the program. Using Tableau Prep, I cleaned and transformed the data, prioritizing fields such as salary, education, debt, marital status, and household size, which were key to understanding customers' financial situations. I also considered the types and number of services, plans, devices, and subscriptions customers had, helping to determine their current access to essential services and any affordability gaps. In Tableau Desktop, I analyzed the relationships between these variables, identifying customer segments that would benefit most from the program. The insights gained were used to target outreach efforts and tailor the program to the needs of the most vulnerable customers.
